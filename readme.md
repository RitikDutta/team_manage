It facilitates seamless communication between managers and employees, efficient task assignment, progress tracking, and intuitive calendar integration for optimal scheduling and visualization.

---

## **About**

Team Manage is the successor and upgraded version of my previous project, **Chai the People**, developed during a hackathon. Building upon the foundations of Chai the People, Team Manage introduces enhanced features, an improved user interface, and robust backend functionalities to better serve organizational needs.

## **Database Design**

### **Database Connection**

The application connects to a MySQL database using the `mysql-connector-python` library. Database configurations are managed through a `config.py` file, ensuring separation of concerns and ease of configuration.

**Example `config.py`:**

```python
# config.py

DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'app_user',          # Replace with your database username
    'password': 'app_password',  # Replace with your database password
    'database': 'team_manage'    # Replace with your database name
}

# Admin credentials for initial setup
ADMIN_USER = 'root'               # Replace with your admin username
ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'root_password'  # Replace with your admin password

# Secret key for Flask sessions and CSRF protection
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'    # Replace with a secure key
```

### **Database Schema**

The database consists of five primary tables:

1. **Users**
2. **Projects**
3. **Messages**
4. **Holidays**
5. **LoginLogs**

#### **1. Users Table**

Stores user information.

  - `role` (ENUM('manager', 'employee'), NOT NULL)

#### **2. Projects Table**

Stores task information assigned to employees.

- **Columns**:
  - `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)

  - `end_time` (TIME)

#### **3. Messages Table**

Stores messages exchanged between users.

- **Columns**:
  - `message_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
  - `sender_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY to `Users.user_id`)
  - `receiver_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY to `Users.user_id`)
  - `content` (TEXT)
  - `timestamp` (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

#### **4. Holidays Table**

Stores holiday requests made by employees.

- **Columns**:
  - `holiday_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
  - `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY to `Users.user_id`)
  - `start_date` (DATE)
  - `end_date` (DATE)
  - `reason` (TEXT)

#### **5. LoginLogs Table**

Stores login records for employees.

- **Columns**:
  - `log_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
  - `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY to `Users.user_id`)
  - `login_date` (DATE)
  - `login_time` (TIME)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **Unix or MacOS:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

6. **Initialize the Database**

   The application includes a script to initialize the database schema and create necessary tables.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   *Upon running, the script will create the database and tables as per the schema.*

7. **Create an Admin User**

   - Access the registration page at `http://localhost:5000/register`.
   - Register a new user with the role `manager`.

### **Configuration**

All configurations are managed through the `config.py` file. Ensure that sensitive information like database passwords and secret keys are kept secure and not exposed in version control.

**Example `config.py`:**

```python
# config.py

DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'app_user',          # Replace with your database username
    'password': 'app_password',  # Replace with your database password
    'database': 'team_manage'    # Replace with your database name
}

# Admin credentials for initial setup
ADMIN_USER = 'root'               # Replace with your admin username
ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'root_password'  # Replace with your admin password

# Secret key for Flask sessions and CSRF protection
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'    # Replace with a secure key
```

---

## **Configuration**

All configurations are managed through the `config.py` file. Ensure that sensitive information like database passwords and secret keys are kept secure and not exposed in version control.

**Example `config.py`:**

```python
# config.py

DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'app_user',          # Replace with your database username
    'password': 'app_password',  # Replace with your database password
    'database': 'team_manage'    # Replace with your database name
}

# Admin credentials for initial setup
ADMIN_USER = 'root'               # Replace with your admin username
ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'root_password'  # Replace with your admin password

# Secret key for Flask sessions and CSRF protection
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'    # Replace with a secure key
```

---

---

## **Security Considerations**

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed before storage.

- **Input Validation**: User inputs are validated using WTForms validators to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

- **CSRF Protection**: Flask-WTF provides CSRF protection for forms.

- **Session Management**: Flask-Login manages user sessions securely.

- **Error Handling**: Sensitive error messages are not exposed to users.

---

## **Error Handling**

- **Try-Except Blocks**: Database operations are wrapped in try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

- **User Feedback**: Flash messages inform users of successes or failures.

- **Logging**: Errors are printed to the console for debugging during development.

---

## **Future Improvements**

- **User Interface Enhancements**: Improve the design and usability of the interface.

- **Email Notifications**: Implement email notifications for messages and task updates.

- **File Uploads**: Allow attachments to tasks and messages.

- **Reporting**: Generate reports on task progress and employee performance.

- **Permissions**: Implement more granular permissions and roles.

- **Unit Testing**: Add tests to ensure code reliability.

- **Deployment**: Prepare the application for deployment in a production environment.

---

## **Conclusion**

Team Manage provides a robust platform for task management within an organization. With features like user authentication, task assignment, messaging, and calendar integration, it facilitates efficient communication and workflow management between managers and employees. By following this documentation, developers can understand, set up, and further enhance the application to meet specific needs.

**Note**: Always ensure to keep sensitive information secure, especially when configuring database connections and secret keys. For production environments, consider using environment variables and secure credential storage solutions.
